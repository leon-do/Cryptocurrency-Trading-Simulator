To make a trade, you'll have to first select how you are going to pay for that trade from the 'From' drop-down list. This drop-down list will only populate with assets you have in your wallet. Next select with coin you want to buy from the 'To' drop-down list. Finally, you'll have to enter an amount for how much you wish to purchase.
